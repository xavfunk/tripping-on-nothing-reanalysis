## Placebos, Psychedelics and Honest Reporting

## Overview
This project will take a second the data presented in the 2020 study ['Tripping on nothing: placebo psychedelics and contextual factors'](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-020-05464-5#Fig2) published in Psychopharmacology. The paper was presented in an online meeting of Oldenburg's UniMind group in February 2021. Most notably, it contained the graph shown below, which I find appauling, for three reasons:

1. The graph is cluttered, yet does not convey relevant information
2. The authors compare **individual** 5D-ASC scores with **means** from other studies
3. The authors dropped two participants, reportedly because their 5D-ASC scores were too high before the experiment

Luckily, the data of all 33 participants is provided along the publication, free for everyone to download. This means that we can take a look at the [data](https://osf.io/xqtnh/) ourselves.
